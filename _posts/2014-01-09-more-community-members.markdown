A week ago I wrote a post giving props to some of the members of the RubyMotion community, and it went off like a rocket, so I figure it's something you guys are interested in.

Here are a few more awesome people to follow or read their stuff, because they're fantastic!

## Lori Olsen

[Lori](https://twitter.com/wndxlori) is a great programmer, [speaker](http://www.wndx.com/speaking/), and [writer](http://www.wndx.com/books/core-data-in-motion)! And I was excited to see, a member of [DevChix](http://www.devchix.com/) and [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/).

This from her about me just sums up how great she really is: "Helping to make a career in software development into a more welcoming opportunity for all women is very, very important to me."

I'm really hoping I get to meet her soon in person, hopefully we'll bump into each other at a conference!

## Neeraj Singh

[Neeraj](https://twitter.com/neerajdotname) has done great things for the RubyMotion community by creating [16 videos](http://bigbinary.com/videos/learn-rubymotion) (so far) about RubyMotion development! He's also the founder of [BigBinary](http://bigbinary.com/) and as he said, he's loving the work he does, and I can imagine so, he seems to have worked with pretty awesome people.

Him and I have some little secret plans going on which we'll announce soon enough.

## Michael Erasmus and Hendrik Swanepoel

[Michael](https://twitter.com/michael_erasmus) and [Hendrik](https://twitter.com/hendrikswan) are the creators of [MotionCasts](http://motioncasts.tv/). Though they've been quiet recently, their screencasts are fantastic, and were a great tool when I was moving over to RubyMotion.

## Abhishek Nalwaya

[Abhishek](https://twitter.com/nalwayaabhishek) is the author of [RubyMotion iOS Development Essentials](http://www.packtpub.com/rubymotion-ios-development-essentials/book). A great read for anyone doing RubyMotion work. He's also been on the conference circuit a while. Definitely someone to learn from and follow.

## Nikolay Nemshilov

[Nikolay](https://twitter.com/nemshilov) is the creator of the super brilliant [under-os](http://under-os.com/) for RubyMotion. Powerful programmer, and generally a really on the ball guy. Just been chatting with him about planning a few episodes on under-os, he's certainly someone to be paying attention to.

## Would love to mention more!

If you think I've missed someone, give me a shout, and I might make this a somewhat regular thing to post about people doing cool stuff for the community. [info@fluffyjack.com](mailto:info@fluffyjack.com)

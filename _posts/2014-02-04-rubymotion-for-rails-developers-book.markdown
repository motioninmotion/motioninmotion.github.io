title: RubyMotion for Rails Developers Book
layout: post

I've just opened up pre-orders for my new book RubyMotion for Rails Developers! Easy to follow, but most certainly not just an introduction. By the end of the book you'll be able to create brilliant production ready applications for both iOS and OS X.

## Pay what you want!

I'm taking a risk and going with a weird pre-order model (though I'm of course not the first to do this). While pre-orders are open, you choose the price you pay for the book! Yep, you can pay anything between $1 and $1000.

## Check it out

This is going to be a short and sweet post about the book, because there is a great deal more about it on the page for the book.
